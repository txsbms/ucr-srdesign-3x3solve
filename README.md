# EE175A/B @ UCR - Rubik's Cube Solving Machine
Senior Design Project (EE175A/B) at UC Riverside.
Team Members: Thomas Sullivan, Kenghao Cai, Justin Morimoto

This is the software portion of a Rubik’s Cube solving machine. It will take a 3x3 Rubik’s Cube with any scramble and solve it automatically. The machine does so by using one camera as input, and controls a cube with five stepper motors. Involves usage of OpenCV and PySerial on a Raspberry Pi 4B with an Arduino Uno board and ATmega328P microcontroller.
