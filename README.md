# EE175A/B @ UCR - Rubik's Cube Solving Machine
This is the software portion of a Rubik’s Cube solving machine. It will take a 3x3 Rubik’s Cube with any scramble and solve it automatically. The machine does so by using one camera as input, and controls a cube with five stepper motors. This was completed as a part of EE175A/B - Senior Design Project at UC Riverside.
